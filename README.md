LZ77
====

This repository contains the simple implementation of Data Compression Technique LZ77 implemented in Matlab

To use it, clone <a href="https://github.com/shripalindia/LZ77.git">https://github.com/shripalindia/LZ77.git</a> to your Matlab Projects folder or to run it directly, open the LZ77.m in your Matlab and run from it. A prompt will appear. Click on "Add to Path" button and the program will execute.

This Program will take it's input String from LZ77_Input.txt file, and write the output to the LZ77_Output.txt file. Also, you set the option if you want to display the String in the Output. This string will not be written to the output file. It will only be displayed in Matlab.

The other two methods, LZ78 and LZSS are also been implemented in Matlab.

Their link is as follows:

</ul>

Hope that this simple implementation of LZ77 in Matlab helps you.
